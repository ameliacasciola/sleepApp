# sleepApp
We created a mobile application alarm which also indicates user's sleep quality for the night. Sleep quality is determined by analyzing the pattern of heart rate and blood oxygen level throughout the night. The mobile application consists of 9 mini-games that users have to win in order to turn the alarm off. It also provides the local weather, time and news information and keeps track of the score for all users.

Tools Used: ARM DS5 development studio, Java, Retrofit, Open Weather api, Spotify api, accelerometer, biometric sensor, De1soc, Django database.
